        <p class="col-12" id="article-4-son">Paper! Invented by the Chinese, popularised by Arabian trade, printed in Europe… could it be that this truly global medium has finally achieved its ultimate true expression - the absolute pinnacle of all human wisdom and literature - in our latest releases: The Guide to The Nether and The End and The Guide to Redstone? Well, probably not, but they are jolly fine books, with pages packed of learned goodness about that game we all love: Minecraft.

            Here’s what I say in the introduction to The Guide to Redstone!

            Thanks, me. Couldn’t have said it better myself. Because I did say it. Um. Anyway, the book’s great - entirely thanks to the expert brain behind it, Craig Jelley, who did nearly all those tricky word things and the thinking bits behind them. It also looks stunning! Have a look at these rather lovely spreads!

            Anyway, the important thing is what sticks with you after you put the book down. Hopefully it’ll give you all the tools and inspiration you need to make even more amazing builds! Our aim for our second book is a little different: survival! The Nether and The End are two of the harshest, deadliest places in Minecraft - even the most hardy adventurer can come a cropper without proper preparation. And that’s what this book is all about! What does that wise sage - me - have to say about it in the introduction?

            Wow. What insight. But not nearly as insightful as that master of Minecraft fact, Stephanie Milton, whose brilliant words reveal many of these places' strange secrets. Let’s have a look at a spread or several, eh?

            My word! And soon, hopefully, your words as well, if you choose to purchase them online or from your nearest booskhop. Click here to order the Guide to Redstone and click here to order the Guide to The Nether and The End.
